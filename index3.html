          <p>Looking a lot like a pancake,
            aaloo paratha is actually a flatbread stuffed
            with a richly seasoned mashed potato.
            <ul>
              <li>The coriander, cumin, turmeric, chili powder,
                and ginger bring a nice savory flavor that is complemented by a dollop of
                chilled yogurt and your favorite pickle or chutney on the side.</li>
              <li>Parathas also taste delicious with a drizzle of fresh, thick cream or
                a bit of unsalted, homemade butter.</li>
              <li>Price : Rs 100/- </li>

          <p>Butter Chicken (Murg Makhani) is one of the top orders at any Indian restaurant in the West and for good reason—it is delicious.
            This sultry poultry dish tastes great with kaali daal (black lentils), naan, and a green salad.
            <ul>
              <li>If you have a well-stocked spice drawer, the only ingredient you may need is kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</li>
              <li>Otherwise, this recipe calls for common ingredients like olive oil, onion, garlic, ginger, butter, chicken stock, and tomato puree. </li>
              <li>The chicken is marinated twice, once in a dry rub and then in a yogurt mixture.</li>
              <li>This makes the chicken moist and flavorful,
                adding to the richness of the dish</li>
              <li>Price : Rs 450/-</li>

      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text1">
          <p>Chicken tikka is one of the most popular dishes in India, where tender chicken chunks are marinated in special spices (coriander, garam masala, ginger paste) and yogurt and then grilled on skewers.
            <ul>
              <li>You can either make mini individual skewers or thread
                the chicken tikka onto large skewers and remove the
                chunks onto a platter for guests to pick up with toothpicks. </li>
              <li>Either way, this may be the most sought after app at the party.</li>

                and gets its name and green color from the healthy spinach, peas, and fresh coriander leaves.</li>
              <li>When combined with potatoes, ginger, and chaat masala (a spice powder mix), the result is a delicious
                and filling veggie patty that's perfect as a snack or part of a meal.</li>
